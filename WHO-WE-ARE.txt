Hi there,

I am Kvc - An unofficial Programmer, Who has this vision in mind. But, Let's not talk about "me" - let's Talk about "us" - The TEAM. We call Ourselves - TheBATeam, and We make and share our Hobby projects with each-other to Learn, Explore and Grow Together.

This Awesome Project is created by One of the Legend in Batch Programming World - "DarkBatcher". Generally, at TheBATeam - we follow a Standard to distribute the projects (folder structure), but we are keeping this project exactly same as it is distributed by the author.

Make sure to appreciate their work via comments on www.thebateam.org

We are Following this Standard For All the Project: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Ar6vSkzIwi0TvPDSpYFlf-cOT9AX7U3w-fJJ6J1V_o/edit
